# DA Encoder

This document outlines the steps to setup your own DA encoder.

### Hardware Requirement

There are two versions of the encoder: one that utilizes the CPU and another that utilizes the GPU, each with different requirements. For the CPU version, using more CPU cores will result in faster encoding speeds, whereas the GPU version requires an NVIDIA GPU.

### Installation, Run

See [0g-da-encoder](https://github.com/0glabs/0g-da-encoder?tab=readme-ov-file#0g-data-avalability-encoder) for details.
